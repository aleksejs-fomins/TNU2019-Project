	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/509653},
	doi = {10.1101/509653},
	abstract = {Multi-photon calcium imaging (CaI) is an important tool to assess activity among neural populations within a column in the sensory cortex. However, the complex asymmetrical interactions among neural populations, termed effective connectivity, cannot be directly assessed by measuring the activity of each neuron using CaI but calls for computational modeling. To estimate effective connectivity among neural populations, we proposed a dynamic causal model (DCM) for CaI by combining a convolution-based dynamic neural state model and a dynamic calcium ion concentration model for CaI signals. After conducting a simulation study to evaluate DCM for CaI, we applied it to an experimental CaI data measured at the layer 2/3 of a barrel cortical column that differentially responds to hit and error whisking trails in mice. We first identified neural populations and constructed computational models with intrinsic connectivity of neural populations within the layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex and extrinsic connectivity with latent external modes. Bayesian model inversion and comparison shows that a top-down model with latent inhibitory and excitatory external modes explains the observed CaI signals during hit and error trials better than any other model, with a single external mode or without any latent modes. The best model also showed differential intrinsic and extrinsic effective connectivity between hit and error trials (corresponding to the bottom- up and top-down processes) in the functional hierarchical architecture. Both simulation and experimental results suggest the usefulness of DCM for CaI in terms of exploration of the hierarchical interactions among neural populations observed in CaI.},

	abstract = {A problem of great interest in real world systems, where multiple time series measurements are available, is the estimation of the intra-system causal relations. For instance, electric cortical signals are used for studying functional connectivity between brain areas, their directionality, the direct or indirect nature of the connections, and the spectral characteristics (e.g. which oscillations are preferentially transmitted). The earliest spectral measure of causality was Akaike's (1968) seminal work on the noise contribution ratio, reflecting direct and indirect connections. Later, a major breakthrough was the partial directed coherence of Baccala and Sameshima (2001) for direct connections. The simple aim of this study consists of two parts: (1) To expose a major problem with the partial directed coherence, where it is shown that it is affected by irrelevant connections to such an extent that it can misrepresent the frequency response, thus defeating the main purpose for which the measure was developed, and (2) To provide a solution to this problem, namely the "isolated effective coherence", which consists of estimating the partial coherence under a multivariate auto-regressive model, followed by setting all irrelevant associations to zero, other than the particular directional association of interest. Simple, realistic, toy examples illustrate the severity of the problem with the partial directed coherence, and the solution achieved by the isolated effective coherence. For the sake of reproducible research, the software code implementing the methods discussed here (using lazarus free-pascal "www.lazarus.freepascal.org"), including the test data as text files, are freely available at: https://sites.google.com/site/pascualmarqui/home/icoh-isolated-effective-coherence},

	abstract = {This report reviews the conceptual and theoretical links between Granger causality and directed information theory. We begin with a short historical tour of Granger causality, concentrating on its closeness to information theory. The definitions of Granger causality based on prediction are recalled, and the importance of the observation set is discussed. We present the definitions based on conditional independence. The notion of instantaneous coupling is included in the definitions. The concept of Granger causality graphs is discussed. We present directed information theory from the perspective of studies of causal influences between stochastic processes. Causal conditioning appears to be the cornerstone for the relation between information theory and Granger causality. In the bivariate case, the fundamental measure is the directed information, which decomposes as the sum of the transfer entropies and a term quantifying instantaneous coupling. We show the decomposition of the mutual information into the sums of the transfer entropies and the instantaneous coupling measure, a relation known for the linear Gaussian case. We study the multivariate case, showing that the useful decomposition is blurred by instantaneous coupling. The links are further developed by studying how measures based on directed information theory naturally emerge from Granger causality inference frameworks as hypothesis testing.},
